iNSPROv20.0
===========

Indoor Navigation System

INSPRO v2.0 Requires FLITE 1.4 and openCV2.framework. The app source code in this repository already has all the 
source code and files needed to build and run the application from an iPhone. 

To Use the Application:

  1. If it is the first time using the app, go to the Settings tab and press the Calibrate button. You will be told
     to "start walking, stop walking and turn around" for a total of 4 times. Or you can use the default option.

  2. In the Navigation tab, you can either hold the phone in your hand and press the Start, Stop, Directions button
     to start the app, stop the app once you are done walking and directions to start listening to the instructions.
     Or you can use headphones and put the phone in your packet and start the sequence of Start -> Stop -> Directions
     by pressing the Stop/Play button in the apple's or any other headphones with volume control. A single click of the
     play/stop headphone control button is required to go from one state to the next.

  3. To run the app again, quit the app and start the app again (This will be fixed in later updates so that there is
     no need to restart the app again)

Knowns bugs:
 - Calibration step: The system repeats the same message twice
